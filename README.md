# Basic-Data-Base-Created-to-Simulate-an-Apothecary-Item-Inventory

Project Title and Description: Apothecary Database
I collaborated with a partner on a MySQL database. It was intended to manage product information for a theoretical apothecary website,
ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval. I practiced creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram(ERD) and normalized the database to Third Normal Form
using Google Sheets. I also developed a select amount of SQL queries to demonstrate the relationship between tables through primary and foreign keys.
This ensured the data integrity and relational accuracy. During the presentation, we decided to make a creative spin by simulating the database on
Minecraft. This gave a visual edge for our representation of the project, and inspired creative flare for future projects completed in other courses.


Installation Instructions: This requires MySQL. (I need to acquire a copy of the SQL script file from Alexis.)

Usage Instructions: This website is giving me a hard time about attaching images. View images on my linkedIn.

We focused on exploring common SQL features as follows:
- creating procedures for calculating total price of a customer's cart.
- declaring variable types
- Looping orders to prep
- Joining tables to simplify and organize what remains in the inventory after purchases
- Unary and More table relationships
- Forming an ERD Diagram
- Trying different table queries on potential thingss an employee would search for about a customer or product.

Features and Technology Stack: Utilized Minecraft to simulate the apothecary, and the items we store and keep track of through this database.
